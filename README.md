# Playlight (Website)
Indies, unite. Playlight is the best way to get your game seen.

## Backend
Looking for the backend code? It is available [here](https://github.com/therealPaulPlay/Playlight-Backend).

## SDK
Looking for the SDK? It is available [here](https://github.com/therealPaulPlay/Playlight-SDK).

## Developing

The Playlight website uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) together with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Shadcn-Svelte components](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com/).
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
