			<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
			<p>
				By accessing or using the Playlight platform ("Service") provided by Paul Rhomberg ("we," "us," or "our"), you
				agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Service.
			</p>

			<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">2. Description of Service</h2>
			<p>
				The Service is an open, integrated game discovery platform designed to be embedded directly into your
				website. It utilizes an algorithm to analyze user interactions and deliver personalized game recommendations
				while striving to keep data anonymous. This approach enables you to maintain control over your content while
				connecting your game with a broader audience.
			</p>

			<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">3. Service Duration and Availability</h2>
			<p>
				3.1. Any reference to "lifetime" access or similar terms refers to the period during which we continue to
				operate and maintain the Service. We reserve the right to discontinue the Service at any time without prior
				notice.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.2. We do not guarantee uninterrupted access to the Service and may modify, suspend, or terminate the Service
				at our discretion.
			</p>

			<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">4. User Responsibilities</h2>

				4.1. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your integration, including but not limited to database
				security, access controls, and API keys.

			<p>4.3. You are responsible for backing up any data associated with your use of the Service.</p>

			<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
			<p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties, either express or implied.</p>
			<p>
				We shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages
				resulting from:
			</p>
			<ul class="mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
				<li>Your use or inability to use the Service</li>
				<li>Unauthorized access to or alteration of your data</li>
				<li>Statements or conduct of any third party on the Service</li>
				<li>Any loss of data, revenue, or profits</li>
				<li>Any bugs, viruses, or other harmful components that may be transmitted through the Service</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">6. Data Management</h2>
			<p>6.1. You retain all rights to the data you store using the Service.</p>
			<p>
				6.2. We do not access, monitor, or process your data except as required for providing technical support when
				explicitly requested.
			</p>
			<p>6.3. You are responsible for ensuring your use of the Service complies with relevant data protection laws.</p>

			<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">7. Intellectual Property</h2>
			<p>
				7.1. The Service's source code is provided under an MIT license, often combined with a Commons Clause. The
				specific terms of that license apply to the code, and you can find the exact license in the "LICENSE" file in
				the corresponding code repositories.
			</p>
			<p>
				7.2. All other aspects of the Service, including but not limited to trademarks, logos, and documentation, remain
				our exclusive property.
			</p>

			<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">8. Modifications to Terms</h2>
			<p>
				8.1. We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the Service after such
				modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
			</p>
			<p>8.2. It is your responsibility to review these terms periodically for changes.</p>

			<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">9. Payments and Subscriptions</h2>
			<p>
				We do not take responsibility for defects that may affect your user experience or issues with in-game purchases
				or subscriptions. When issues arise, we may be able to help or offer a refund if applicable by law, but cannot
				guarantee the functionality of the Service, as it depends on various factors, including device-specific
				properties. Some features of the Service may require payment. By purchasing a digital or physical item or
				subscribing, you authorize Paul Rhomberg ("PaulPlay") to charge your selected payment method. Payment fees are
				non-refundable except as required by law, and subscription prices are subject to change.
				<br /><br />
				Attempting to circumvent subscription fees using multiple accounts or integrations for the same site is not permitted
				and may result in termination.
			</p>

			<h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">10. Termination</h2>
			<p>
				10.1. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to the Service without prior notice for any reason.
			</p>
			<p>
				10.2. Upon termination, all provisions of these terms that by their nature should survive termination shall
				continue to apply, including ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
			</p>
